# NERPS anarchy
A simple character sheet for Shadowrun Anarchy. Very inoffical and with lots of house rules. Create a character and share the link with your game master :)

This is a beta version. Please contribute!

### TODO

I want to make this thing look pretty. Maybe add some character advancement. And I want to make print-outs fit on the template from the SRA book (which I can not provide -- go buy the book or the pdf). 

### References

The shadowrun license belongs to the Topps company. This is an open source non-commercial fan project. The code is published under the GPL 3.0. I was inspired by the Shadowrun Anarchy book and many homebrew rules. Special thanks to Kevin u/Gingivitis- Duncan, u/cssmythe3, and others for these publications where I copied Amps and Qualities:
